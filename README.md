# Schools-Social-Mirrors

Project Summary

The goal of this project is to discover the extent to which a school’s inequality mirrors that of its community’s. Although some believe that schools act as the springboard of social equality and progress, others argue that schools merely reinforce the existing stratification found in their societies. In order to test the idea of whether schools serve as social mirrors, I will analyze two main forms of inequality, race and gender, in two separate spheres -- the school and the community. Ultimately, I hope to discover whether a correlative relationship exists between inequality in a community and inequality in schools.
